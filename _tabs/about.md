## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to my blog ! Here you will find explanations and tutorials about what I like doing on iOS and macOS.

## My goal
I hope to publish here all the info I wish I had found online when I needed it. \
When I got started in this field, I had trouble finding clear information, and today, I would like to explain what I've understood and continue discovering everyday in a short and informative way.

## The subjects I will write about
As I mentionned, most of my articles will be about iOS and macOS, because I love Apple devices and I've been doing experiments on them since I'm quite young.\
As a result, I will write mostly about these platforms, but fortunately there are many things that can be reproduced on Linux if necessary.\
I may not write very often, because we all have limited time and I want to keep most of my time reserved for my projects. I have so much to learn ! But when I find something interesting, I will try and write an article about it !

## Hackintosh
I discovered IT when my parents gave me their old Compaq laptop. It had a 32 bits Intel Pentium, and it was already several years old. \
Around 2012, my parents had their first iPhones (4 & 4s) and that's how I discovered Apple. About 2 years later, I was already a dedicated Apple fan, but I only knew about iPhone and iPad. And one day, a friend of mine told me about her Mac, and I said "A Mac, what's that ?"\
That's how I discovered that Apple was also making Macs, and I wanted one too. But my parents had a Toshiba PC running Windows 7, and it was not in their plans to buy a Mac anytime soon.\
Then, one of my cousin told me about Hackintosh, which he had seen a video about on YouTube ; and I decided to give it a try.\
Of course, it was an absolute failure because at that time, I knew absolutely nothing about IT in general, but I didn't give up. Searching for alternative OSs to Windows, I discovered Linux, which I installed on my Compaq. I started to learn a lot, and things stayed like that for a few years.\
At the end of 2016, Apple released their famous MacBook Pro with TouchBar, and since I had been  trying to run macOS on my PC without any success despite months of efforts, my mother decided to make me a wonderful present, and she purchased a 15 inch MacBook Pro for our family.\

Things started to get serious around this time, as I could get my hands on a real Mac. I discovered that macOS was even better than I could imagine :) and I really learnt a lot more about Macs.\
Having a real Mac at home didn't stop me from continuing to try and get macOS running on my PC and when I got my first "real" PC (an HP Omen i7-7700HQ with Nvidia GTX 1050Ti Mobile), I continued my efforts. \
Finally, in October 2021, I succesfully booted macOS Catalina on my PC. I spent several months making patches to it, and among that, I patched its ACPI tables myself to disable the Nvidia eGPU. That was quite _difficult_, but I did it.

## Jailbreak
I jailbroke an iPhone for the first time on April 1st 2016, it was my mother's old iPhone 4 with Pangu. Since then, I've jailbroken every iPhone that came into my hands !\
This year (2021-2022), I had to do a scientific project for school, and I decided to develop a jailbreak myself. That's how I developed Iris, my own jailbreak for research purposes.\
I've used an iPhone 7 on iOS 11.2.6 because I wanted to use Bazad's incredible Blanket exploit but it didn't work out of the box on my iPhone and I didn't have time to fix the exploit. So I instead used sock\_port as an exploit and started building the post-exploitation.\
At the end of the summer 2021, Iris for iOS 11 was ready, with a binpack and an ssh server, so I decided to port it to iOS 13.7, which worked fine after some modifications.\
I am now planning to include a proper bootstrap with Procursus + Sileo, but I'm feeling a bit lazy to patch CoreTrust right now :) But I will most probably do it one day.

I will open source it once my exams are done.
